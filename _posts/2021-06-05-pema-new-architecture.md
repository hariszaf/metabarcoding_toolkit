title: PEMA has now a new architecture
---

PEMA has been re-architectured completely! 

All previous modules are now available, i.e all four marker genes (16S/18S rRNA, ITS and COI) are supported
and custom reference databases can be used both for the CREST and the RDPClassifier cases. 

Aim of this re-architecturing was to make PEMA much more friendlier to **contribute**! 

Metabarcoding is an extremely active method! 

That is why PEMA's intention is to become an open source project
asking for the contribution of anyone who would like to join forces! 

For a thorough description on how you could do that, you may have a look [here](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

💯 🖥️ Happy coding! 🖥️ 💯
