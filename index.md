***site unde construction!***



<p class="message">
  Hey there! <br>
  This is the PEMA main site for <i>how to use</i> issues and further metabarcoding tips and hints!
</p>




You may find PEMA as a [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/hariszaf/pema) and as a [Singularity](https://singularity-hub.org/collections/2295) container.

Here is the [PEMA GitHub repository](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema) if you want to have a look on the source code and why not, to [contribute](https://github.com/hariszaf/pema/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to!

For any running issues you may have, or for any further features you would like to see included on PEMA, you can reach us through the [PEMA Gitter community](https://gitter.im/pema-helpdesk/community#)

Thanks for your interest on PEMA!
Keep metabarcoding!

The PEMA team
